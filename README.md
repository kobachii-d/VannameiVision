    <h1>VannameiVision: An Optimized Probabilistic Deep Learning for Susceptible Shrimp Larvae Detection</h1>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Detecting susceptible shrimp larvae is a critical challenge that requires sophisticated techniques and expertise. This project, VannameiVision, presents a novel approach to address this issue. Leveraging the combined power of probabilistic deep learning, transfer learning, and deep metric learning using a triplet loss function, we've introduced a highly optimized model for susceptible shrimp larvae detection.

Our extensive research and experiments, backed by 5-fold cross-validation, allowed us to draw some significant conclusions:
</p>

<p align="justify">
    <ul>
        <li>Integrating transfer learning and deep metric learning dramatically enhances the performance of our system.</li>
        <li>When integrated with our proposed techniques, DenseNet121's efficiency remarkably improved, marking an accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 87%, and specificity of 97%.</li>
        <li>The model, after specific tuning, displayed a promising ability to generalize across unseen datasets, achieving over 90% accuracy across varied backgrounds, including different colors and textures.</li>
    </ul>
