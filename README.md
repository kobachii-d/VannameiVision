    <h1>VannameiVision: An Optimized Probabilistic Deep Learning for Susceptible Shrimp Larvae Detection</h1>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Detecting susceptible shrimp larvae is a critical challenge that requires sophisticated techniques and expertise. This project, VannameiVision, presents a novel approach to address this issue. Leveraging the combined power of probabilistic deep learning, transfer learning, and deep metric learning using a triplet loss function, we've introduced a highly optimized model for shrimp larvae detection.
