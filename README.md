<p align="justify">
In aquaculture, early detection of susceptible shrimp larvae is of paramount importance to maintain healthy production environments. This GitHub repository introduces VannameiVision, a novel approach that combines probabilistic deep learning with transfer and deep metric learning techniques to address the challenge of accurately identifying shrimp larvae in such vulnerable conditions.

Our experiments, backed by 5-fold cross-validation, allowed us to draw some significant conclusions:
</p>

<p align="justify">
    <ul>
        <li>Integrating transfer learning and deep metric learning dramatically enhances the performance of our system.</li>
        <li>When integrated with our proposed techniques, DenseNet121's efficiency remarkably improved, marking an accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 87%, and specificity of 97%.</li>
        <li>The model, after specific tuning, displayed a promising ability to generalize across unseen datasets, achieving over 90% accuracy across varied backgrounds, including different colors and textures.</li>
    </ul>
