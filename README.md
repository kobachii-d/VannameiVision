    <h1>VannameiVision: An Optimized Probabilistic Deep Learning for Susceptible Shrimp Larvae Detection</h1>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Detecting susceptible shrimp larvae is a challenge that necessitates specialized expertise. We propose an optimized approach, leveraging probabilistic deep learning with transfer learning and deep metric learning using a triplet loss function. Our method achieves high accuracy and robustness, particularly with the DenseNet121 model.
