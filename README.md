    <h1>VannameiVision: An Optimized Probabilistic Deep Learning for Susceptible Shrimp Larvae Detection</h1>
</p>

<p align="justify">
In aquaculture, early detection of susceptible shrimp larvae is of paramount importance to maintain healthy production environments. This GitHub repository introduces "VannameiVision", a novel deep-learning approach specially designed to address the challenge of accurately identifying susceptible shrimp larvae.

Our experiments, backed by 5-fold cross-validation, allowed us to draw some significant conclusions:
</p>

<p align="justify">
    <ul>
        <li>Integrating transfer learning and deep metric learning dramatically enhances the performance of our system.</li>
        <li>When integrated with our proposed techniques, DenseNet121's efficiency remarkably improved, marking an accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 87%, and specificity of 97%.</li>
        <li>The model, after specific tuning, displayed a promising ability to generalize across unseen datasets, achieving over 90% accuracy across varied backgrounds, including different colors and textures.</li>
    </ul>
