    <h1>VannameiVision: An Optimized Probabilistic Deep Learning for Susceptible Shrimp Larvae Detection</h1>
</p>

<p align="justify">
In aquaculture, early detection of susceptible shrimp larvae is of paramount importance to maintain a healthy and thriving production environment. Yet, conventional detection methods often rely heavily on the expertise of human specialists, a time-consuming process prone to errors.
</p>

<p align="justify">
With the rapid advancement in machine learning technologies, there emerges a promising avenue for automating and enhancing the precision of such detections. This GitHub repository introduces "VannameiVision", a novel deep learning approach meticulously designed to address the challenge of accurately identifying susceptible shrimp larvae.
